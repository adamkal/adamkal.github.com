What will I get from this presentation
======================================

# how many of you have code coverage 80%?
# how many of you have code coverage 90%?
# how many of you have code tested so well that you could tell your CI to 
  deploy automaticaly when all tests pass?
# how about documentation? Is it so good that anybody could take it and deploy
  it anywhere?
# what about python 3 support?
# there are dozens of good practices we should follw
# why don't we?
# because we don't get a ticket for it
# forcing is not the answer - when you are forced to do somenting you'll
  probably do it poorly

Examples:
# documentation: when it should be written? With code. When do we find out that
  something is missing? The same moment it should be completed -> use games
# tools: we write simple tools like ipython profiles - shere them -> use games

Fancy things to say
-------------------

Bed tests are better then none but I don't know they are worth the the waisted time it took to write them.
